# Yahoo-Fantasy-Sports-Demo
This is a sample project created to demonstrate some core competencies and design principles for an Oath Fantasy Mobile iOS Developer position.

NOTE: The demo is not finished as of the last commit, but I wanted to upload it before submitting my application. Networking is only live in a few parts of the app, but the underlying data structure is there. All of the networking should be live by the end of the weekend along with other improvements to source code.
